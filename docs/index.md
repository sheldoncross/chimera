# Welcome to Project Chimera

Project Chimera is a synthetic data generation platform for training Large Language Models (LLMs). The system creates high-fidelity conversational data by orchestrating discussions between multiple AI models and grounding them with real-time human data.

## Architecture Overview

Project Chimera follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication:

### Core Services

1. **[Data Ingestion Service](data-ingestion-service.md)** âœ… **Completed**
   - Scrapes topics from news sources (Hacker News)
   - Pushes topics to Redis queue for processing
   - FastAPI-based with Scrapy integration

2. **[Orchestration Service](orchestration-service.md)** ðŸš§ **In Development**
   - Orchestrates conversations between multiple LLMs
   - Event-driven architecture using Kafka
   - Manages conversation state with Redis
   - **Status**: Core architecture and tests completed, implementation in progress

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, asyncio
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **State Storage**: Redis for conversation state and topic queues
- **LLM Integration**: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- **Containerization**: Docker, docker-compose
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio

### Data Flow

1. **Topic Ingestion**: News topics scraped and queued in Redis
2. **Conversation Creation**: Topics pulled from queue to start conversations
3. **LLM Orchestration**: Multiple models engage in structured discussions
4. **Quality Assessment**: Conversations scored and validated
5. **Data Output**: Completed conversations published for downstream processing
